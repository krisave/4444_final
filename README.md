# 4444_final
Final project for CSC 4444
How to run:
- Make sure Python is installed
- Open the terminal and navigate to the sudoku_solver folder and go to the sudoku_solver.py file
- Press the run button at the top if in VSCode
- Once you press run, the terminal will prompt you to enter 9 digits per line for 9 lines. If you have never played sudoku before, I will include a bunch of examples for you to use in the txt file named "example_user_input.txt"
- The program should take the terminal input and solve it using Constraint Satisfaction
